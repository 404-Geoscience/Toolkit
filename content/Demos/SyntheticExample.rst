2.1. Analysis of Simple Bodies
==============================

As a primer to interpreting magnetic data, letâ€™s get familiar with the magnetic responses of some simple geologic bodies. We will then grid the magnetic data, and investigate different visual enhancements of the data, and apply several tools that will aid us in our geological interpretation of the magnetic data.

The geologic model
------------------

For this demonstration, a simple 3D geologic model was built attempting to capture several different types of geologic bodies.

The geologic bodies are represented by three different blocks superimposed on a background:

**Block 1**: Large strongly magnetic domain, reflective of a magnetic plutonic complex or magnetic volcanic rock package.

**Block 2**: Small strongly magnetic domain, reflective of a shallow magnetic intrusion.

**Block 3**: North-west trending, steeply-dipping non-magnetic feature inside the large magnetic block, reflective of a fault zone along which magnetite-destruction has occurred.

**Background**: Weakly magnetic background, reflective of weakly magnetic volcanic rocks.

The extents of the survey area are approximately 3 km x 3 km.

This geological model will be used to both demonstrate magnetic response and to showcase some of the geophysical tools available in the Geophysical Toolkit. Each processing step is presented separately in a series of Jupyter notebooks, where additional information can be found on that particular application.
