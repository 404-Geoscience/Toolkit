2.2.3. Search Case Study - Edge Detection and Depth to Source
=============================================================

Here we apply the tilt-depth method discussed in Section 2.1.4. to estimate depth to source in the Search Phase II magnetic data. Depth can be accurately derived from the tilt angle where contacts between magnetically contrasted geological units are vertical. Because of the typically complex nature of true geological contacts, calculated depths calculated from real magnetic data sets are usually approximations. The results should always be considered in light of expected geology, and ideally should be interpreted alongside geology, topographic data, and other geophysical data and models if these data are available.

The images below show the TMI (left image) and the tilt angle (right image) with edges and source depths estimated using the tilt-depth method.
