    "## Magnetic response of a simple geologic model\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnetic response (total field anomaly) of the geologic model is calculated on a series of east-west flight lines running roughly perpendicular to the general strike of geologic boundaries and structures featured in the model. Flight line spacing is 200 m. Data was collected at a flight height of 40 m. Topography is assumed to be flat in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "An east-west profile through the magnetic data is shown below. The magnetic data are in nanoteslas (nT). The profile location can be changed using the slider bars (labelled East, North, Azimuth, and Length), and the number of sampling points can be varied by typing a number into the box labelled 'Sampling'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responses of the smaller and larger magnetic blocks are obvious in the profile, and occur directly over the sources (due to the magnetic field inclination being vertical in this example). The fault within the large eastern magnetic block is observed as a more subtle dip in the magnetic response.\n",
