    "\n",
    "2D magnetic data filters are commonly applied to magnetic data to allow us to view that data in different ways. They can highlight shallower or deeper magnetic sources, and can emphasize gradients in the magnetic data that occur at geological contacts and in association with structure.\n",

    "We use the same synthetic model here as in the previous notebook to demonstrate the effects of various 2D magnetic filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short descriptions of select filters are provided in the sections below. Summaries of various filters and their role in gravity and magnetic data interpretation can be found in Roest et al., 1992, MacLeod et al., 1993, Miller and Singh, 1994, Milligan and Gunn, 1997, Verduzco et al., 2004, Isles and Rankin, 2013, Dentith and Mudge, 2014.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Upward continuation can be considered a ‘wavelength’ filter. Upward continuation simulates the magnetic response that would be observed if data were collected at a greater height above the Earth’s surface than it was actually collected. The result is that longer-wavelength, deeper features are emphasized over shorter-wavelength, near-surface features. It is effective for interpretation of deeper geology, or for reducing noise that may be found in data collected very close to the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can alternate between the upward contined response here and the TMI data using the drop-down menu labelled 'Grid Filters': ![gridfilters](./images/grid_filters_dropdown_20per_ppt.PNG)  Change the upward continuation height, or distance, using the slider bar labelled 'UpDist' (the default is 0 m, so you will need to change it to observe a change in the data): ![upwarddistSlider](./images/updist_height_20per_ppt.PNG) Note the small magnetic anomaly and the narrow fault feature quickly become indistinct with increased height. \n",

Interpreters should not consider X and Y derivative results independently, and should be sure to evaluate both, since visualizing gradients in one direction will de-emphasize features trending in the perpendicular direction. The X and Y derivatives are also used in the calculation of several other magnetic data filters.\n",

Note the emphases on east and west geological boundaries using the X derivative, and on the north and south geological boundaries using the Y derivative (best seen in relation to the smaller magnetic anomaly).

    "\n",
    "A magnetic source exhibiting a strong contrast with surrounding rocks (e.g. a large, near surface, magnetic unit) will yield both high vertical and horizontal gradients, and a more weakly contrasting body will yield proportionally smaller vertical and horizontal gradients. Normalizing the vertical by horizontal derivatives means different amplitude responses are assigned equivalent values. This is a very useful filter for enhancing more subtle features in the magnetic data. The tilt angle ranges from -90 to +90 degrees, is positive over the magnetic source, and negative outside the source, with the body’s edge delimited by the 0 degree contour.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to view the tilt angle using a color map that highlights the middle, or near-zero tilt angle values, which should trace source edges. For example, the red-blue color map (RdBu). \n",

    "In the grid image below, you can see that zero values trace the edge of the small magnetic body, with positive tilt angle values directly over the top of (inside) the body and negative values outside the magnetic body.

The analytic signal is a very useful interpretation product in areas where magnetic remanence is suspected, and in areas of low latitude since it is not affected by magnetisation direction.  \n",
