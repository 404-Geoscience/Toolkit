    "## Gridding the magnetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic data should be gridded prior to applying transforms and filters. This means that the flight line data must be interpolated on a regular 2D grid. There are numerous possible ways to grid data (Briggs, 1974; Parker et al., 1983). The minimum curvature method is shown to be robust and yield a sensible and smooth result, so we have chosen minimum curvature as the default option to complete the gridding for the synthetic model data. We have provided options below to explore the gridding resolution and the method using the drop down menus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting gridded data shows the larger and smaller magnetic bodies, and the magnetic low related to the northwest trending structure cross-cutting the larger magnetic domain.\n"

    "\n",
    "Simple enhancements to the image can help an interpreter better visualize features within magnetic data. Applying sun-shading from various angles, experimenting with colour contrast, and adding contour lines are a simple means to explore the data initially. Various image enhancement options can be tested on the synthetic gridded magnetic data below.  \n",

    "**Sun-shading**. Try using the slider bars above the map - they look like this - ![sunshade](./images/shading_contours_20per_ppt.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "to change the direction (SunAzimuth) and angle (SunAngle) of sun shading, to vary color transparency (ColorTransp) and sun-shade transparency (HSTransp), change the vertical scale (vScale), and to manipulate magnetic contour lines (MagContour).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Color maps**. The color map, or color 'look-up table', can also be changed. \n",
    "**Color stretch**. Finally, the color stretch can be changed using the color normalization drop-down (Color Norm):![colornorm](./images/color_normalization_25per_ppt.PNG)\n",
    "Here we've allowed two options, a linear stretch (Linear), and a histogram equalized (HistEqualized) stretch. Using a linear stretch, the values within a range of magnetic data are mapped to 256 classes or bins within a chosen color map in a linear manner, meaning if there are few anomalously high values (outliers) in the range, the 'strongest' color values will be mapped rarely. If there are many middle-range values, the image may be flooded with mid range color values. While a linear color stretch will highlight the most anomalous values, it can wash out subtler features in the data. Histogram equialization will vary the color bin sizes to map an equal number of data points per bin, essentially giving equal weight to low, mid-range, and high magnetic values.       "
