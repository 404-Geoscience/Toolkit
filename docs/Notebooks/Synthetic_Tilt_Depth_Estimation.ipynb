    "# 2.1.4.\tSynthetic - Depth to Source#\n",
    "\n",
    "There is yet more useful information that we can derive from a suite of high quality magnetic data, again using some simple techniques. It is possible to obtain information about the depth to the top of a magnetic body from magnetic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the depth to a magnetic source is valuable for many reasons. Having an approximation of the depth of a body, especially if it is expected to represent ore, is invariably useful for planning drill targets. In the case of some geologic bodies that might be related to mineralization such as porphyry intrusive bodies, the shape or topography of the intrusion can indicate were the regions of highest fluid flow might have occurred. Results of depth to source modelling can be used as a guide and starting point for 3D geological modelling or further exploration of the shape of the anomaly using forward modelling or inversion techniques. Depending on of course the physical properties, specifically the magnetic susceptibility, of the rock types within a study area, and their distribution and orientation, it is possible to find the depths to not only compact magnetic bodies, but possibly depths to the basement in general, or depths to particular stratigraphic horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will find the depth of both the small high magnetic susceptibility body and the larger magnetic block in the 3D synthetic geologic model. We will use the tilt-depth method (Salem et al., 2007, Blakely et al., 2016) to do this. The tilt angle, discussed in Notebook 2.1.2., considers the vertical and horizontal magnetic gradients. Depth can be estimated where the tilt angle is zero, at the edge or margin of a feature or source. Depth to the edge of a source is then approximately half the distance between the 45deg and -45 degree contours of the calculated tilt angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inclination must be 90, thus reduced to pole data is used in this calculation. This method assumes that the magnetic body is simple and also vertically-sided, which means that the depth estimation will be less accurate for dipping bodies or bodies with complex margins. \n",
