    "Calculating horizontal and vertical derivatives of the magnetic response gives us a way to better visualize local gradients in the data that can be obscured by larger and deeper features in the total field response. X and Y derivatives are calculated based on the difference observed in magnetic response between adjacent points, or grid cells, in the X and Y directions, respectively. Steep gradients usually occur at geologic contacts, faults, or fractures, where there is a distinct contrast in magnetic susceptibility. Interpreters should not consider X and Y derivative results independently, and should be sure to evaluate both, since visualizing gradients in one direction will de-emphasize features trending in the perpendicular direction. The X and Y derivatives are also used in the calculation of several other magnetic data filters.\n",

Note the emphases on east and west geological boundaries using the X derivative, and on the north and south geological boundaries using the Y derivative (best seen in relation to the smaller magnetic anomaly). Image sun-shading and color can be varied, and the filtered data can be compared with the original total mangetic intensity (TMI) data using the 'Grid Filters' drop-down menu. "

    "The tilt derivative or tilt angle normalizes the vertical derivative by the horizontal derivatives. A magnetic source exhibiting a strong contrast with surrounding rocks (e.g. a large, near surface, magnetic unit) will yield both high vertical and horizontal gradients, and a more weakly contrasting body will yield proportionally smaller vertical and horizontal gradients. Normalizing the vertical by horizontal derivatives means different amplitude responses are assigned equivalent values. This is a very useful filter for enhancing more subtle features in the magnetic data. The tilt angle ranges from -90 to +90 degrees, is positive over the magnetic source, and negative outside the source, with the body’s edge delimited by the 0 degree contour.\n",
