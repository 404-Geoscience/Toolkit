    "The magnetic response (total field anomaly) of the geologic model is calculated on a series of east-west flight lines running roughly perpendicular to the general strike of geologic boundaries and structures featured in the model. Flight line spacing is 200 m. Observations are at the Earthe's surface. Topography is assumed to be flat in this example. \n",

    "The responses of the smaller and larger magnetic blocks are obvious in the profile, and occur directly over the sources (due to the magnetic field inclination being vertical in this example). The fault within the large eastern magnetic block is observed as a more subtle dip in the magnetic response, offset to the east as a result of it's eastward dip."
